    <h1>Description About FoodCourt::</h1>
    <p>A food court (in Asia-Pacific also called food hall or hawker centre)[1] is generally an indoor plaza or 
        common area within a facility that is contiguous with the counters of multiple food vendors and provides a 
        common area for self-serve dinner. It can also be a public dining area in front of a cafe or diner.
        Food courts may be found in shopping malls, airports, and parks. In various regions (such as Asia, the Americas, and Africa), 
        a food court may be a standalone development. In some places of learning such as high schools and universities, 
        food courts have also come to replace or complement traditional cafeterias.</p>
